## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte / SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) - UI and full-stack framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- pure CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After some experience with Svelte v4, I used Svelte v5 for the first time in this project and was able to internalize a lot of new things. I also learned how to create customizable carousels and other components for individual cases.

### Useful resources

- [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) - collection of open-source fonts that are packaged into individual NPM packages
